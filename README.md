# 👋Hello
I’m **Ammaar Aslam**, I'm a self taught developer / programmer from **Sri Lanka.**
I started my programming journey back in 2018 by learning from free online tutorials and now I have mastered the fundamentals of programming and learned some of the most popular 
programming languages and tools such as **Python, Javascript, ReactJS, Django, HTML, CSS, FLutter, Dart, etc..**
I am still learning and trying to improve my current skills and learn new ones. 

**Proud to be a programmer in this amazing community**

**:love_you_gesture::rocket:HAPPY CODING**
